# Binary Search Tree

In this program we build a Binary Search Tree with #insert, #delete, #find, #level_order #postorder, #inorder, #preorder, #height, #depth, #balanced, and #reblanced methods. This program includes a script that will build a tree based on a array of random numbers, checks if it's balanced, and traverses it with BFS and DFS methods. It will then unbalance it, confirm that its unbalanced, rebalance it and traverse it again with BFS and DFS methods. 

## How to Run

You can run this on replit at https://replit.com/@gabriel2342/binarysearchtree#.replit

## Features
A library of methods to build and manipulate binary search trees.

## Reflection
This project followed the linked lists project and added to my knowledge of data structures and algorithims. It took significant reading outside of the curriculum to understand the correct approach to building the tree and traversing it which is a pattern that I expect to conitnue as I reach the end of the Ruby curriculum.
